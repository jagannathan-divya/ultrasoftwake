The code performs a 2D Inverse Fourier transform (IFFT) to compute the stationary surface wake pattern left behind a source moving with uniform speed in an ultrasoft solid, following a gravity-capillary-elastodynamic theory for a given set of parameters, namely the Froude number (Fr), Bond number (Bo), scaled shear wave speed (cs), and number of spectral modes (nk). In addition, it detects the leading ridge of the wake pattern and measures the corresponding opening half-angle.
